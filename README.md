# software-guild-work

Projects I did in C# / .NET during my time as an apprentice at The Software Guild.

Learned and practiced necessary OOP principles.
Started with projects in the command line - Battleship / Janken (Rock Paper Scissors) / Flooring mastery.

Moved to using ASP.NET for other projects.

May eventually update projects or re-create with Java.
